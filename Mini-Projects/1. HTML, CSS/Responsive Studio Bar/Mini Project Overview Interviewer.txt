Mini Project Overview Interviewer:
----------------------------------
This project is a responsive sidebar navigation menu designed for a web application called "Studio Bar." The sidebar provides users with easy access to various sections of the website, such as the Gallery, Exhibits, Events, Store, Contact, and more. It also includes social media links for quick access to the application's social channels.

Key Features:
----------------
Responsive Design:
The sidebar menu is responsive and hidden by default. Users can toggle it by clicking a hamburger menu icon. When the menu is expanded, it overlays the main content, providing a sleek and modern user interface.

Smooth Animations:-
The menu transitions smoothly in and out of view with CSS animations. This was achieved using CSS transitions for the left property, giving the interface a polished feel.
Font Awesome Integration:

Icons from Font Awesome are used for both the menu items and the social media links, adding visual clarity and making the interface more intuitive.
User Interaction:

The sidebar includes buttons to open and close the menu, providing a user-friendly experience. When the menu is opened, the hamburger icon is replaced with a close icon, which is made visible through CSS.

Technical Details:
-------------------
HTML Structure:
The HTML provides a clean structure with sections for the menu, the logo, and social media links. The use of <ul> and <li> tags ensures semantic correctness for the menu items.

CSS Styling:
The project uses a combination of absolute and fixed positioning to control the layout of the menu and the toggle button.
Custom styles are applied to create the transparent background and the hover effects for the menu items, enhancing the user experience.
The background image and fonts are loaded externally, with a Google Font providing a modern, clean look.

Challenges & Solutions:
------------------------

Making the Sidebar Responsive:
Ensuring that the sidebar is responsive was a key challenge. This was addressed by setting the sidebar's width to a fixed size and using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

Smooth Transition:
Implementing smooth transitions required careful tuning of the CSS properties. By using the transition property, the appearance and disappearance of the sidebar were made to feel seamless.

Conclusion:
------------
This project demonstrates my ability to build a responsive, user-friendly sidebar navigation using modern web development practices. It highlights my skills in HTML, CSS, and the integration of external libraries like Font Awesome.
